# NES Emulator written in Rust (WIP)

This project is an attempt to create a NES emulator for fun. Right now I'm only attempting to emulate the MOS 6502 CPU. See [assets/notes.txt](assets/notes.txt) for my notes as I work on this.

## How to run

Right now everything is test based, so just run `cargo test`.
